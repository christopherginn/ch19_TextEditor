  ## Installation
  After cloning/forking this repo, from the root directory, run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

  ***

  ## Usage
  After all of the dependencies are installed, run `npm start`. 
  This will run the build, creating a directory called `dist` and run the server at the same time. 

  You can then view the app running at http://localhost:3000.

  The app is also live on Heroku at [link to heroku](https://warm-journey-66381.herokuapp.com/)

  Here is J.A.T.E. running in the browser:

  Since it's a PWA, we can install it as an app for offline usage on our machine:
